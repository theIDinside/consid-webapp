# Consid Web App

This is just a simple web application to display some technical abilities. It's kind of like a lab of sorts,
if you've ever went to Uni.

# Usage
There are some requirements to get this application running

## Installing 3rd party libraries 
Or what Microsoft and all the new-age techies call "packages". These include;
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

This application uses Microsoft's "Entity framework", in an ASP.NET MVC application.

As a backend, we're using SQL Server, and it took me way too long to get it working on Linux, so I certainly hope
that it's as easy to set up on windows for that goodie cross-platform development (spoiler, Windows=not fun).
